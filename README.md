This program is a calculator that can take in multiple people using hashmaps. It takes in more than one value per person like using receipts. 
It calculates based on the amount of people input and takes the average total and then stores the total amounts owe/owed to each person input.

I made this program as I found during trip expenses with friends, it was a hassle to calculate the amount per person and who owes what total amount.
So this was made just to make the calculations easier.
